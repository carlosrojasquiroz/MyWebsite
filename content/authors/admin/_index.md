I'm a graduate student in the Master of Economic Analysis at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. Previously, I worked as a Senior Economist at the Fiscal Council of Peru (2018-2020). 

Here I upload documents about classes I've taught, my previous professional works, and some research papers I've published during the last years.
